# Somatic
The Somatic is a wearable keyboard and mouse. It translates hand signs and motions into action, like the somatic component of a spell in Dungeons and Dragons.

See the project in action at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6raRftH9yxM!

**This project is defunct!!** The EM7180SFP is no longer in production, and I can't put any more effort into this project to design around it. Consider this a starting point only!

The Somatic project's priorities are:
* Control any wearable computer with a heads-up display
* Ready to use all day, instantly, with no Internet
* Fast enough to do a quick search in less than 10 seconds

The Somatic does not:
* Use any cloud services at all
* Reproduce your hand in 3-D space
* Let you type on a virtual keyboard
* Cause fatigue or interfere with other tasks

The project is still in a pretty rough state. If I revisit the project, the priorities are:
* Lay out and fab circuit board
* Make case smaller
* Replace on/off Hall sensors with continuous sensors
